# PADNet

Peak area detection network (PADNet) directly learns to predict the phase region from the raw (2D) XRD image without any need for explicit preprocessing and background removal. PADNet contains specially designed large symmetrical convolutional filters at the first layer to capture the peaks and automatically remove the background by computing the difference in intensity counts across different symmetries.
